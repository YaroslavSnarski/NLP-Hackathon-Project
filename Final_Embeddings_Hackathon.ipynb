Rather than accept an impossibly low offer (if they even had an offer), they decided to rent out their properties. The idea was to cover expenses while waiting for the market to right itself.But in recent months, a number of these accidental landlords have been surprised to find renewed buyer interest in their properties. The problem is, the renters are happily in place. These accidental landlords are part of the \\\"shadow inventory\\\".My definition of \\\"shadow inventory\\\" are units that aren't currently listed on the market, but will probably be listed soon. This includes REOs (bank Real Estate Owned) that are not currently listed, foreclosures in process and seriously delinquent loans (although some of these may be cured, and some may already be listed as short sales), unlisted new high rise condos (these properties are not included in the new home inventory report) and homeowners waiting for a better market.A growing regulatory crackdown\\\"Construction Developer Says Banks Suddenly Playing Hardball, Asks 'Mish, What's Going On?'\\\" (Mish's Global Economic Trend Analysis) Today I received an email from \\\"Construction Insider\\\" concerned about banks suddenly playing hardball and calling in construction loans.Construction Insider writes: Hi MishI work in the construction business and something has been creeping to the forefront of my attention for the past few weeks and now it seems to be moving full steam ahead.Banks are forcing developers/builders (especially smaller ones) to give up their properties (unsold homes and lots).Banks say the reason is that the properties in question are no longer performing assets. I am sure there are some loans out there that are not performing and the owners are going under. I am equally sure that there are plenty of developers that are still selling homes - just not at the pace originally planned on the pro formas.Diminishing government support\",\n          \"BREAKING: Trump Blocks Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal FATHER'S DAY, 2012 - - - - - - - BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, A PROCLAMATION Every day, ordinary Americans make extraordinary contributions to the well-being of our children and the strength of our Nation by answering one of life's greatest callings -- parenthood. Morning, noon, and night, they dedicate themselves to their sons and daughters, expressing a love that knows neither beginning nor end through small daily acts. On Father's Day, we honor the men whose compassion and commitment have nourished our spirits and guided us toward brighter horizons. For many of us, our fathers show us by the example they set the kind of people they want us to become. Whether biological, foster, or adoptive, they teach us through the encouragement they give, the questions they answer, the limits they set, and the strength they show in the face of difficulty and hardship. Our fathers impart lessons and values we will always carry with us. With their presence and their care, they not only fulfill a profound responsibility, but also share a blessing with their children that stands among our truest traditions. Every father bears a fundamental obligation to do right by their children. Yet, today, too many young Americans grow up without the love and support of their fathers. When the responsibilities of fathers go unmet, our communities suffer. That is why my Administration is working to promote responsible fatherhood by helping dads re-engage with their families and supporting programs that work with fathers. And that is why men across our country are making the decision every single day to step up; to be good fathers; and to serve as mentors, tutors, and foster parents to young people who need the guiding hand of a caring adult. All of us have a stake in forging stronger bonds between fathers and their children. Today, we celebrate men who have risen to the task, who raised us, and who do that most important work of parenting, day in and day out, with love, humility, and pride. NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 17, 2012, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth. /s/ BARACK OBAMA\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4971,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Is Zillow Stock a Buy?\",\n          \"TreeHouse Foods Is A Cash Flow Machine (NYSE:THS)\",\n          \"Social networking creates a nation of job flirts\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2018,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2012-04-12\",\n          \"2016-10-24\",\n          \"2010-10-13\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Rather than accept an impossibly low offer (if they even had an offer), they decided to rent out their properties. The idea was to cover expenses while waiting for the market to right itself.But in recent months, a number of these accidental landlords have been surprised to find renewed buyer interest in their properties. The problem is, the renters are happily in place. These accidental landlords are part of the \\\"shadow inventory\\\".My definition of \\\"shadow inventory\\\" are units that aren't currently listed on the market, but will probably be listed soon. This includes REOs (bank Real Estate Owned) that are not currently listed, foreclosures in process and seriously delinquent loans (although some of these may be cured, and some may already be listed as short sales), unlisted new high rise condos (these properties are not included in the new home inventory report) and homeowners waiting for a better market.A growing regulatory crackdown\\\"Construction Developer Says Banks Suddenly Playing Hardball, Asks 'Mish, What's Going On?'\\\" (Mish's Global Economic Trend Analysis) Today I received an email from \\\"Construction Insider\\\" concerned about banks suddenly playing hardball and calling in construction loans.Construction Insider writes: Hi MishI work in the construction business and something has been creeping to the forefront of my attention for the past few weeks and now it seems to be moving full steam ahead.Banks are forcing developers/builders (especially smaller ones) to give up their properties (unsold homes and lots).Banks say the reason is that the properties in question are no longer performing assets. I am sure there are some loans out there that are not performing and the owners are going under.

Morning, noon, and night, they dedicate themselves to their sons and daughters, expressing a love that knows neither beginning nor end through small daily acts. On Father's Day, we honor the men whose compassion and commitment have nourished our spirits and guided us toward brighter horizons. For many of us, our fathers show us by the example they set the kind of people they want us to become. Whether biological, foster, or adoptive, they teach us through the encouragement they give, the questions they answer, the limits they set, and the strength they show in the face of difficulty and hardship. Our fathers impart lessons and values we will always carry with us. With their presence and their care, they not only fulfill a profound responsibility, but also share a blessing with their children that stands among our truest traditions. Every father bears a fundamental obligation to do right by their children. Yet, today, too many young Americans grow up without the love and support of their fathers. When the responsibilities of fathers go unmet, our communities suffer. That is why my Administration is working to promote responsible fatherhood by helping dads re-engage with their families and supporting programs that work with fathers. And that is why men across our country are making the decision every single day to step up; to be good fathers; and to serve as mentors, tutors, and foster parents to young people who need the guiding hand of a caring adult. All of us have a stake in forging stronger bonds between fathers and their children. Today, we celebrate men who have risen to the task, who raised us, and who do that most important work of parenting, day in and day out, with love, humility, and pride. NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 17, 2012, as Father's Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on this day, and I call upon all citizens to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and

The Hillary Clinton-Russia Nexus The acting director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, told Congress on Thursday that President Trump's firing of James Comey has not derailed the agency's investigation into possible collusion between Russia and the Hillary Clinton campaign. Which is good news. Despite Mrs. Clinton's assertion that the idea of collusion is \\\"a total hoax,\\\" and despite many unknowns, the links continue to pile up. Here is a partial accounting of the connections we do know something about. THE CLINTON FAMILY BUSINESS There may be no Clinton Foundation office in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but it is not for lack of trying. Bill Clinton received half a million dollars in 2010 for a speech he gave in Moscow, paid by a Russian firm, Renaissance Capital, that has ties to Russian intelligence. The Clinton Foundation took money from Russian officials and oligarchs, including Victor Kekselberg, a Putin confidant. The Foundation also received millions of dollars from Uranium One, which was sold to the Russian government in 2010, giving Russia control of 20% of the uranium deposits in the U.S. \\u2014 the sale required approval from Hillary Clinton's State Department. What's more, at least some of these donations weren't disclosed. \\\"Ian Telfer, the head of the Russian government's uranium company, Uranium One, made four foreign donations totaling $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all such donors,\\\" the Times has reported . JOHN PODESTA In March \\u2014 that is, long after the election was over \\u2014 it was revealed that Mrs. Clinton's campaign chairman had failed to disclose the receipt of 75,000 shares of stock from a Kremlin-financed company \\u2014 Joule Unlimited \\u2014 for which he served as director from 2010 to 2014, when he joined the Obama White House in 2014. Podesta apparently had a large chunk of the shares transferred to \\\"Leonidio Holdings, a brand-new entity he incorporated only on Dec. 20, 2013, about 10 days before he entered the White House,\\\" according to a news account . TONY PODESTA Mr. Podesta's brother, who has close personal and business relations with Mrs. Clinton, was \\\"key lobbyist on behalf of Sberbank, according to Senate lobbying disclosure forms. His firm received more than $24 million in fees in 2016, much of it coming from foreign governments, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics,\\\" a March news story reported. The bank was \\\"seeking to end one of the Obama administration's economic sanctions against that country.\\\" The report goes on to note that \\\"Podesta's efforts were a key part of under-the-radar lobbying during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign led mainly by veteran Democratic strategists to remove sanctions against Sberbank and VTB Capital, Russia's second largest bank.\\\" Mr. Obama imposed the sanctions following the Russian seizure of the Crimean region of Ukraine in 2014. JOHN BREAUX Forbes magazine reports that Mr. Breaux, a former Senator from Louisiana who cut radio ads for Mrs. Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents Gazprombank GPB , a subsidiary of Russia's third largest bank, on \\\"banking laws and regulations, including applicable sanctions.\\\" THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN In March, Mr. Putin's spokesman said that Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak met with members of Mrs. Clinton's campaign several times while she was running for president in 2016. Further, the campaign never disclosed the number or nature of these secret meetings. Mrs. Clinton and her associates can cry themselves hoarse that there is neither smoke nor fire here, and that Putin was behind her election loss. But all in all, the known facts suggest an unusually extensive network of relationships with a major foreign power. Anyone who cares about the credibility of the American electoral process should want a thorough investigation. * OK, this is not really what The New York Times wrote in its editorial (the actual editorial can be found here ). But it does closely track what the Times' editorial accuses Trump of doing, and the Times' accusations about a Trump \\\"nexus\\\" with Russia are just about as flimsy. Top Democrats, as indicated above, also have a long history of business and political ties with Russia, for the simple reason that there is money to be made by people who can peddle their political connections. And sometimes these Democrats don't disclose their Russia ties. If this is all the Times needs to accuse Trump and his associates of having \\\"an unusually extensive network of relationships with a major foreign power,\\\" then Clinton is equally guilty. (The one difference is that Hillary actually has a record of being soft on Russia.) Of course, Clinton isn't president, so who cares? Still, even if she had won the presidency, would The New York Times, or anyone else for that matter, have cared one whit about her \\\"extensive\\\" ties with Russia? Somehow, that seems unlikely.\",\n          \"Muni issuers' exposure to the battle against COVID-19 varies.

But most recently, markets told a different story, as muni yields rose-and prices fell-more than Treasury yields. Investors are now asking: aren't many municipal bond issuers vulnerable in this crisis?Muni issuers' exposure to the battle against COVID-19 varies. Some sectors, such as hospitals, are on the front line. Others, such as state governments, may experience not only first-order effects as budgets stretch to accommodate virus-related expenditures but also the secondary effects of a crisis-induced local or broad-based recession.So, what steps can muni investors take to protect themselves and earn income as the crisis rages? The most critical step is to stay active. Passive laddered strategies have no ability to maneuver through the crisis, nor can they efficiently rotate into higher-yielding issues as rates climb. In contrast, active and flexible strategies can help muni investors better respond to the risks-and opportunities-that emerge in challenging environments like this one.Municipal Yields Sharply HigherOne outcome of recent market activity has been the significantly increased attractiveness of municipal bond yields after taxes, relative to Treasuries.US Treasury yields saw an unprecedented decline in the past few weeks, with the yield on the 10-year note plunging to a record low of 0.32% at one point on March 9. It's since made its way back to around 1.0% but remains well below the 1.9% level where it began the quarter.In contrast, municipal bond yields have risen, with 10-year yields now at 1.7%, compared to 1.4% at the start of the year. The ratio of municipal yields over Treasury yields-a measure of the relative attractiveness of municipals-is now around 400% for one-year securities and nearly 200% for intermediate-maturity and long bonds. A municipal/Treasury ratio above 100% indicates investors should strongly favor municipal bonds over Treasuries.Investors who had the flexibility to allocate part of their muni portfolios to one- and 10-year US Treasuries, as we suggested in January, should pay heed to that relationship. Now that the after-tax yield relationship between municipals and Treasuries has flipped, we think it's time to rotate those short-maturity Treasury holdings back into munis.Tax-Exempt Bond Issuers Show ResilienceMunicipal bond issuers tend to be resilient under challenging conditions. Defaults, for example, are extremely rare among tax-exempt bonds. Moody's Investors Service reports that the average five-year US municipal default rate since 2009 has been just 0.16%.Moreover, municipal issuers are much better equipped to weather a storm than they were in 2001 or 2007 as other crises loomed. Since then, municipal governments have used the longest economic expansion on record to shore up their balance sheets and rainy-day reserve funds with skyrocketing tax receipts. In fact, states began the coronavirus crisis with record-level reserves (Display).Given states' and other municipal issuers' strong financial positioning, we don't think that the current economic downturn will result in broad bondholder impairment. However, as the crisis continues to unfold, we do anticipate disruptions and downgrades. That makes careful credit research more critical today than ever.Challenges vary by sector:State and Local GovernmentsThe situation: As already noted, states have repaired their balance sheets and built cash-funded reserves to historic levels. In the short run, costs associated with fighting the coronavirus will surely rise, but pending aid in the form of a higher federal share of Medicaid costs should help soften the blow.The challenge: As we saw in 2008, broad-based revenues such as sales and income taxes decline in economic recessions. Today, a drop-off in sales tax revenues is certain, with so many tax-generating businesses-from sports venues to shopping malls-shutting down and tourism halting. As layoffs begin, income tax revenue will suffer too. Ultimately, however, states and municipalities have the authority to raise taxes, tap reserves and cut expenditures, allowing them to ride out a downturn.HospitalsThe situation: Most major healthcare facilities have enough financial liquidity to weather tighter margins. If additional funds are needed to ensure hospitals' ability to meet community service needs during the crisis, we believe facilities will receive federal, state or local financial support.The challenge: Under normal conditions, higher patient volumes would help boost margins. But the significantly higher patient volumes seen in a far-reaching health emergency are likely to squeeze margins instead. Shortages of medical supplies, the potential spread of the virus among healthcare workers, and the suspension of more profitable elective procedures could add to operating pressures.Senior LivingThe situation: The elderly are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Elder care facilities in Washington State have been hit particularly hard by infections among residents, visitors and staff.The challenge: Beyond the human tragedy, facilities may suffer long-term reputational damage, especially as cases rise and potential containment breaches along with them. As they fight the outbreak, they may see fixed costs, such as caregiver salaries and food, increase as supplies grow scarcer or require significant pre-ordering. Costs for increased maintenance are already rising as facilities work around the clock to meet the highest industry standards. In general, though, most senior-living facilities have sufficient cash reserves to weather a decline in occupancy for at least a year.UtilitiesThe situation: As essential service providers, water & sewer and electric utilities are generally well-insulated from COVID-19's thick economic cloud due to their diverse customer base.The challenge: We expect reduced demand from commercial and industrial users as more people self-isolate and/or work from home. For the same reasons, residential demand is likely to rise.AirportsThe situation: Larger hubs are better positioned to deal with disruptions in service than are smaller, regional airports. Even though the airline industry is under stress, airlines will continue to make payments to airports. These payments represent just 3% of airlines' budgets, and airports are essential to airlines' survival.The challenge: Between airlines voluntarily cutting flights due to lower passenger volume and federally imposed limitations on travel into the US, most airports will see revenue declines in the coming months. The decrease in travelers will also hurt ancillary revenues, such as concession fees from food courts and newsstands.Higher EducationThe situation: Most colleges and universities have physically closed to help prevent community spread of the virus; students will complete the semester online.The challenge: We expect a modest hit to revenues, as many schools are refunding room and board for the remainder of the school year. Tuition, however, will not be refunded, as courses are being taught remotely. We believe normal operations will resume in the fall, with little drop-off in demand, even if a full-out recession develops. In fact, colleges and universities typically see enrollment in graduate programs rise during economic downturns.Charter SchoolsThe situation: Younger people seem to be less affected by COVID-19, but the key concern is community spread into homes. Charter school revenues are based on average daily attendance from the prior year, so schools are in relatively good position for now. The virus also struck very close to the school year's end, which is leading many states to waive the mandatory 180-day requirement.The challenge: A shift toward \\\"remote learning\\\" alternatives could spark school closings and teacher layoffs. Schools also may be pressured if states dial down aid to students to make up for budget gaps caused by other aspects of the outbreak. However, that may not impact them until the next school year.Preparing for the UnexpectedWe have good reason to think the broad municipal bond market will hold up under the weight of an economic downturn. Municipal bonds generate more income today than three months ago, and over the long run, municipals act as a buffer against equity volatility.But rapidly evolving conditions and heightened uncertainty demand thorough fundamental research and continuous monitoring. In our view, that makes an active and flexible strategy municipal investors' best bet for negotiating the coronavirus crisis.The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations, do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams, and are subject to revision over time.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.\",\n          \"By David BermanKeep an eye on the 10-year Treasury bond yield: It has been climbing fairly steadily since Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke floated the idea (now a reality) of a second round of quantitative easing last August. Back then, the yield sat at just 2.5 per cent, but has since moved to 3.67 per cent.That\\u2019s a cause for some concern, since the bond yield reflects borrowing costs, inflation expectations and a potential investment alternative to stocks. Therefore, equity investors get nervous when the yield rises to uncomfortable territory.But where is this territory? David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff \\u2013 and everyone\\u2019s favourite bearish commentator \\u2013 looked at 10 previous \\u201chiccups\\u201d in the bond yield over the past three years. The average peak in the bond yield has been 4.05 per cent, with a range between 3.85 per cent and 4.3 per cent \\u2013 which implies that the stock market is nearing its pain threshold.\\u201cEven if we go back to the peak of these hiccups, it would still mean we are two-thirds of the way through this; if we end up peaking out at the lower end, then we are 86 per cent of the way there,\\u201d he said in a note.In previous episodes of rising bond yields, the stock market has certainly suffered. However, Mr. Rosenberg is taking the perspective of bond investors here. They are none too pleased to see yields rising, since yields rise when bond prices fall.However, the good news for bond investors is that rising yields tend to be self-correcting. As Mr. Rosenberg explains: \\u201cEven last year, that move to 4 per cent in April brought the stock market down to its knees and this ended up helping turn the Treasury market\\u2019s fortunes around. In other words, these bond selloffs end up being self-correcting once the damage starts to seep into the stock market.\\u201d\\u201cAnd 4 per cent seems to be the yield that the equity market tends to respond to and not in a very friendly way. The good news for the stock market investor \\u2013 we are still 35 basis points away. But at the rate things are going, we may get there by the middle of February.\\u201dDisclosure: None\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Neither did he have many followers in the Chinese social science circle despite the fact that Granet\\u2019s sociological theories and methods derived from his sociological understanding of the ancient Chinese civilization. An analysis will lead us to uncover the cause for such inadequate attention of Granet\\u2019s work \\u2014 it derives primarily from the over-emphasis in the Chinese sociological field on research of modern societies and its related negligence of the Chinese tradition in pursuit of the Western Anglo-American model by a concern with the development of the \\\"scientific Orientalism\\\", which is accountable for the lack of original research in sociological studies of China.

Methods Prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, not-controlled, and single center study conducted on OAG patients who underwent glaucoma surgery with the XEN63 gel stent. The main outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP). Secondary end-points were number of topical ocular hypotensive drugs, percentage of patients achieving an IOP reduction \\u2a7e20%, and treatment-related adverse events. Results Eleven eyes from 11 patients were treated with XEN 63. Mean (95% confidence interval, CI) age was 78.8 (73.7-85.9). Two eyes (18.2%) underwent XEN alone, while nine eyes (81.8%) underwent combined XEN + cataract extraction (phacoemulsification). The median (95% CI) IOP reduction was 17.7% (-13.3% to 34.9%). At the end of the study 9 (81.8%) eyes had an IOP \\u2a7d 18 mm Hg, six of them without treatment. Six (54.6%) eyes obtained an IOP reduction \\u2a7e20%. Compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction in the number of ocular hypotensive drugs (p = 0.0039). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Early postoperative complications included diplopia (1), blood in endothelium (2), ocular hypertension (1), corneal edema (1), folds in Descemet's membrane (1), and contact between the implant and the iris (1). All the adverse events were successfully solved without sequalae. One eye required bleb needling. Conclusion The XEN63 implant significantly reduced both IOP and the amount of ocular hypotensive medications while maintaining a good safety profile.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 525,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2019-06-14\",\n          \"2013-11-05\",\n          \"2011-01-01\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Methods Prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, not-controlled, and single center study conducted on OAG patients who underwent glaucoma surgery with the XEN63 gel stent. The main outcome measure was intraocular pressure (IOP). Secondary end-points were number of topical ocular hypotensive drugs, percentage of patients achieving an IOP reduction \\u2a7e20%, and treatment-related adverse events. Results Eleven eyes from 11 patients were treated with XEN 63. Mean (95% confidence interval, CI) age was 78.8 (73.7-85.9). Two eyes (18.2%) underwent XEN alone, while nine eyes (81.8%) underwent combined XEN + cataract extraction (phacoemulsification). The median (95% CI) IOP reduction was 17.7% (-13.3% to 34.9%). At the end of the study 9 (81.8%) eyes had an IOP \\u2a7d 18 mm Hg, six of them without treatment. Six (54.6%) eyes obtained an IOP reduction \\u2a7e20%. Compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction in the number of ocular hypotensive drugs (p = 0.0039). There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Early postoperative complications included diplopia (1), blood in endothelium (2), ocular hypertension (1), corneal edema (1), folds in Descemet's membrane (1), and contact between the implant and the iris (1). All the adverse events were successfully solved without sequalae. One eye required bleb needling. Conclusion The XEN63 implant significantly reduced both IOP and the amount of ocular hypotensive medications while maintaining a good safety profile.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
